## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Start Recording**:
   ```bash
   ./start_recording.py
   ```

3. **Start Web Interface**:
   ```bash
   uv run python main.py
   ```

4. **Access Web Interface**:
   Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

## Recent Improvements

### Latest Updates (November 2025)
**Performance and usability improvements**

- The site now loads faster thanks to background caching and quicker file reads.  
- Recording lists update instantly instead of waiting for long calculations.  
- Added a setting (`STATS_REFRESH_SEC`, default 30 s) to control how often cached data refreshes.  
- You can now secure specific streams using optional `username` and `password` fields in `radio_channels.json`.  
- Streams without login details continue to work as before.  
- Added sorting options for group, channel, and total minutes.  
- Recording times now automatically display in your local timezone (files are still stored in UTC).  
- Cleaned up and simplified code for easier maintenance.

## Core Components

### Main Application (`main.py`)
Flask web application providing:
- REST API endpoints for channel management
- Recording playback and download
- Cleanup operations and status monitoring
- Web interface serving

### Audio Recording Engine (`audio_recorder.py`)
Handles:
- Multi-channel audio streaming with concurrent processing
- Voice activity detection and transmission filtering
- Audio file processing and metadata creation
- Automatic cleanup and maintenance
- Per-channel volume sensitivity configuration
- Configurable silence gaps (currently 4 seconds)

### Configuration (`radio_channels.json`)
Defines radio channels with:
- Channel names and stream URLs
- Enable/disable flags for selective recording
- Channel grouping for organization
- Volume sensitivity settings per channel

## Usage

## Usage

### Web Interface
- **Channel Overview**: Browse channels in the main table with real-time status
- **Modal Recording Browser**: Click channel names to open detailed recording lists
- **Date/Time Filtering**: Use filters to find recordings within specific time ranges
- **Batch Operations**: 
  - Select multiple recordings with checkboxes
  - **Batch Playback**: Play selected recordings in chronological sequence
  - **Batch Download**: Concatenate and download multiple recordings as single FLAC file
- **Real-time Updates**: Use refresh button in modal windows to update recording lists
- **FLAC Audio Playback**: High-quality lossless audio streaming across all browsers
- **Accurate Timestamps**: All times displayed in correct local timezone (PDT)
- **Progress Feedback**: Visual indicators for processing operations

### Audio Quality & Processing
- **MP3 format**: Optimized for web streaming and storage efficiency
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Smart detection of actual transmissions
- **Configurable silence gaps**: 4-second silence detection prevents false stops
- **Volume sensitivity**: Per-channel sensitivity tuning
- **Automatic filtering**: Removes background noise and short clips

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/channels` - List all channels
- `GET /api/recordings/channel/{name}` - Get channel recordings with date/time filtering
- `GET /api/recording/{filename}` - Download individual recording file
- `POST /api/recordings/concatenate` - Concatenate multiple recordings into single FLAC file
- `GET /api/status` - System status and recording activity
- `GET /api/stats` - Recording statistics and storage information
- `POST /api/cleanup-temp` - Manual cleanup of temporary files
- `GET /api/cleanup-status` - Cleanup statistics and temporary file counts

### Command Line Scripts
- `./start_recording.py` - Start recording daemon for all enabled channels
- `./stop_recording.py` - Stop recording daemon and all processes
- `cleanup_old_recordings.sh` - Remove old recordings (configurable retention)
- `cleanup_temp.py` - Clean up temporary audio files

## Configuration

### Channel Setup
Edit `radio_channels.json` to add/modify channels:
```json
{
  "channels": [
    {
      "name": "Channel Name",
      "url": "https://stream.url/path",
      "enabled": true,
      "group": "Category",
      "volume_sensitivity": 0.01,
      "username": "",
      "password": ""
    }
  ]
}
```
The username and password fields are required for auth-protected streams; if your stream doesn’t require authentication, leave them blank.

### Audio Settings
Key parameters in `audio_recorder.py`:
- `silence_gap`: 4000ms (4 seconds of silence before stopping recording)
- `min_transmission_length`: 500ms (minimum recording duration)
- `max_transmission_length`: 45000ms (maximum recording duration)
- `volume_sensitivity`: Per-channel sensitivity (in radio_channels.json)

## Automated Maintenance

### Temp File Cleanup
- **Startup**: Removes old temp files on application start
- **Background**: Hourly cleanup of orphaned temp files
- **Post-processing**: Immediate cleanup after transmission extraction

### Recording Retention
Set up automated cleanup with cron:
```bash
# Add to crontab for daily cleanup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/stream_recorder/scripts/cleanup_old_recordings.sh
```

## Development
