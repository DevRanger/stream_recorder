# Fix Applied: Start/Stop Recording Scripts

## Issue Resolved
The `scripts/start_recording.sh` script was failing with "No such file or directory" because it was looking for `start_recording.py` in the wrong location.

## Root Cause
During the project cleanup, the `start_recording.py` file was removed, but the shell scripts still referenced it. The scripts were also looking in the `scripts/` directory instead of the project root.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Created Missing Python Scripts**

**`start_recording.py`** (New)
- Standalone script to start recording for all channels
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C)
- Proper logging to both file and console
- Uses the AudioRecorder class from the project

**`stop_recording.py`** (New)  
- Standalone script to stop recording
- Tries API first, falls back to process termination
- Process management with SIGTERM and SIGKILL
- Comprehensive error handling

### 2. **Fixed Shell Script Paths**

**`scripts/start_recording.sh`**
- Changed from `cd "$(dirname "$0")"` to `cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."`
- Now correctly navigates to project root
- Updated reference paths in output messages

**`scripts/stop_recording.sh`**
- Same path fix applied
- Now correctly finds `stop_recording.py` in project root

### 3. **Made Scripts Executable**
```bash
chmod +x start_recording.py stop_recording.py
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ **Foreground Recording**
```bash
./scripts/start_recording.sh
# Successfully starts recording, shows real-time logs
# Stops gracefully with Ctrl+C
```

### ✅ **Background Recording**
```bash
./scripts/start_recording.sh --background
# ✅ Recording started in background (PID: 312932)
# Creates nohup log file
```

### ✅ **Stop Recording**
```bash
./scripts/stop_recording.sh
# ✅ Successfully terminates background processes
# Falls back to process killing if API unavailable
```

## Features of New Scripts

### `start_recording.py`
- **Multi-channel support**: Starts all 25 configured channels
- **Signal handling**: Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C or SIGTERM
- **Logging**: Writes to both `recording.log` and console
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error reporting
- **Status reporting**: Clear startup messages and progress

### `stop_recording.py`
- **API integration**: Tries to stop via Flask API first
- **Process management**: Falls back to process termination
- **Safe termination**: Uses SIGTERM then SIGKILL if needed
- **Multiple process handling**: Finds and stops all recording processes
- **Logging**: Records all stop operations

## Updated Documentation

### Files Updated
- ✅ `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: Added new script descriptions
- ✅ `docs/UV_GUIDE.md`: Updated script path examples
- ✅ Scripts are now properly documented in architecture

### Script Integration
- ✅ All scripts use `uv run` for Python execution
- ✅ Proper working directory handling
- ✅ Consistent logging and error handling
- ✅ Background process management

## Usage Examples

### Development
```bash
# Start in foreground for testing
./scripts/start_recording.sh

# Start in background for production
./scripts/start_recording.sh --background

# Stop recording
./scripts/stop_recording.sh
```

### Direct Python Usage
```bash
# Start recording directly
uv run python start_recording.py

# Stop recording directly  
uv run python stop_recording.py
```

### With Web Interface
```bash
# Start web interface
uv run python main.py
# Use API endpoints for start/stop control
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Reliability**
- Scripts now work correctly without path issues
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Process management ensures clean shutdown

### 2. **Flexibility**
- Can run standalone or via shell scripts
- Supports both foreground and background modes
- Integrates with web API when available

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent with project structure
- Well-documented and tested

### 4. **Production Ready**
- Background process management
- Proper logging and monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The recording scripts now work correctly and provide a robust interface for managing the radio stream recording system. Users can start recording in foreground or background mode, and stop recording cleanly using the provided scripts.
